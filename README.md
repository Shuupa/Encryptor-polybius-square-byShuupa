Let's begin. The encryption method using Polybius square was invented back in Greece in the 2nd century BC. It's a table of the letters of the English alphabet. Each letter has its own number. It is determined by which row and column the letter is in. <br />

For example, we need to encrypt the letter Y. To do this, we find the letter Y in the table and look at the number in which column and row the letter is located. For Y it is row 5, column 4, i.e. the encrypted letter Y will be labeled as 54 <br />
